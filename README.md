Nova is a Python-based personal assistant designed to simplify your daily tasks and enhance your productivity. It uses advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with you in a natural, conversational manner.

## Features

* **Speech Recognition**: Nova can understand your spoken commands, thanks to the powerful speech recognition capabilities of the `speech_recognition` library.

* **Text-to-Speech**: Nova can speak to you, providing auditory feedback or reading out information to you. This is achieved using the `pyttsx3` library.

* **Basic Calculations**: Nova can perform basic arithmetic calculations. Just tell it what you want to calculate, and it will do the math for you.

* **Music Playback**: Nova can play music for you. Just tell it to "play music" or "play song", and it will randomly select a song from your music directory and play it.

* **Jokes**: Need a laugh? Nova can tell you a joke, thanks to the `pyjokes` library.

* **System Control**: Nova can perform basic system operations, like putting the system to sleep or restarting it.

* **Location**: Nova can tell you your current location based on your IP address. Just ask it "where am i" or "location", and it will tell you your current location.

* **Time Telling**: Nova can tell you the current time. Just ask it "the time", and it will tell you the current time.

* **Notepad Opening**: Nova can open Notepad for you. Just tell it to "open notepad", and it will open Notepad.
